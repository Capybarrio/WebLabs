    <h1>A Trump win, an urban high school and an American identity crisis</h1>
    <p>The students had awoken to the news of Donald Trump’s presidential victory only an hour earlier and were still processing what it would mean for them and their families.
        About a dozen gathered in the cafeteria of their high school, which sits on the edge of this former industrial city’s struggling urban core. All were Latino. They had spent Election Day as poll workers, helping non-English speakers, the elderly and the disabled cast their ballots.     
        Shannon Salter, one of the school’s civics teachers, asked them about their work, and the students, talking over one another in bursts of teenage enthusiasm, spoke of the feeling of importance it gave them. After a few minutes, the conversation turned toward the inevitable.
        “So, how do you feel about the result?” Salter asked.
        “I hate it. I hate it,” said Adrianna Rodriguez, 17. “Oh my God, I hate the stupid result.”
        One of the students complained that she was tired of all the election talk. “Let’s worry about 17-year-old girl stuff,” she said.
        Adrianna slammed her hand down on the cafeteria table. “This is 17-year-old girl stuff!” she yelled. On this morning, the day after Election Day, most of her classmates agreed.</p>
  
    <p>Salter understood that for Jennitza and many of her classmates, the election result wasn’t just about a set of policies. To many of them, it felt as if their country had rendered a verdict on their value to the country and found them less worthy than others.
        The students in the cafeteria fell silent. Jennitza took a deep breath.
        “This may not be the day for it,” Salter told them, weighing her words carefully, “but democracy takes work … hard work.”
        And with that, they gathered their belongings and headed to class.</p>
