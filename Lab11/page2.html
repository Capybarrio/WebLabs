    <h1>Retiring soon? Plot a detailed budget first before tapping your 401(k).</h1>
    <p>You might know how to save for retirement. But do you know how to spend your savings after you retire?
    For decades, the “4 percent rule,” laid out by renowned financial adviser William Bengen, served as the north star for financial planners. He estimated that a withdrawal rate of 4 percent a year would allow a retiree to safely spend down their investment account without depleting it.</p>
    <p>Americans between 60 to 64 have a median balance of only $66,900 saved in their employer-sponsored 401(k), while those 65 to 69 have $63,100, according to Fidelity, the largest administrator of workplace retirement plans. Meanwhile, the average balance — which is skewed upward due to the retirement wealth concentrated among the richest Americans — is $239,500 and $244,000, respectively, for those cohorts. And the share of 401(k) millionaires is relatively small, at 2 percent, according to Fidelity. (Those numbers don’t account for an individual holding multiple retirement accounts.)</p>
